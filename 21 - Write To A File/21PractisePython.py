"""Take the code from the How To Decode A 
Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just 
want to play with some different code, use the 
code from the solution), and instead of printing 
the results to a screen, write the results to 
a txt file. In your code, just make up a name 
for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved."""
