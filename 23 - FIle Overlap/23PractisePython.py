"""Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, 
find the numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a 
list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt 
file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be 
divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a 
real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. 
The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)"""
