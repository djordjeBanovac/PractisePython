"""This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting 
an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains 
only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. 
Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension. 
(Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).
The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution 
using one line of Python, but a few readers pointed out that this was 
impossible to do without using sets that I had not yet discussed on the blog, 
so you can either choose to use the original directive and read about the set 
command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and 
use at least one list comprehension in the solution.

Extra:

Randomly generate two lists to test this"""

from random import randint


rand_list1 = [randint(0,20) for elem in range(0,20)]
rand_list2 = [randint(0,20) for elem in range(0,20)]


def common_elements(list1:list, list2:list) ->list:
    """One list comprehension"""
    commons_list = [elem for elem in list1 if elem in list2]
    result_list = []
    for elem in commons_list:
        if elem not in result_list:
            result_list.append(elem)
    return result_list


print("rand_list1",rand_list1)
print("rand_list2 ",rand_list2)
"""one line solution with set"""
print("set: ",set(rand_list1).intersection(rand_list2))
print("function: ", common_elements(rand_list1,rand_list2))
